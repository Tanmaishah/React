Q) What is react?
A)  It is a client side JS library.
    It allows declerative way of programming, componenet focused.
    Allows us to build modern reactive user interfaces.
    React is all about components.
    All UI is built using components
    React components are combining HTML and JS mostly and not much of css


We try building SPA(single page application) and then let JS and react control what is visible to user. This leads to a smoother UI.
Here in this approach HTML page is sent only once.
For routing in react  we will need to use third party libraries.
Q)Why components?
It allows reusability and sepration of concern.
It is just a JS function which returns HTML.
it can return only one html componenet so that is why we put everything in DIV. 

Q) What is declerative way of programming
A) We do not give instructions each and every time as to how it should look rather we give them all the instructions once and all then let react configure how to make things work out.

Index.js is the first file that will be executed
In public folder, we have a div with id root which is called by getElementById in index.js

JSX(JS XML) : Using this we can return HTML code in components, which isn't allowed in regular JS.
