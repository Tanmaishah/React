use let and const over var.
let is used if value changes and const if value remains same.

arrow functions
example 1
const function1=function(name){
    console.log(name)

}

this can be done if only one parameter is passed.
const printmyname=name=>{ 
    console.log(name)
}
this can be done if only one statment is to be executed in function.
const printmyname=name=>    console.log(name)


export and import 
see images also
consider this as person.JS

const person={
    name:'Max'
}
epxort  default person

if we use default export then when we import we can use any name to reference 
Eg: import prs from './person.js'

otherwise we need to do this
import {smt as Smth} from './utility.js'
or 
import * as bundeled from './utility.js'
